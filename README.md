# Plastic Pollution

Microplastics, abandoned fishing gear and other plastic pollution are among our biggest environmental threats. It’s hurting sea animals and making them sick.

Oceanic Society works to improve ocean health by deepening the connections between people and nature to address the root cause of its decline: human behavior.

We’re working to reduce ocean plastic pollution, curb climate change, save sea turtles, and more.
